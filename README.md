Make a strip of LEDs cycle through colours continuously.

The function for varying the values of red, blue and green was derived from the Google colour picker. The function is a pulse which varies between 0 and 255 and remains at 0 afterwards.

The RGB pulses are out of phase so that there is a time when each will be at a maximum while the others are 0.
